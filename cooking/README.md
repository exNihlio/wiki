**Pav Bhaji**

*Note: this does not attempt to be authentic in any way. Consider it to be
pav bhaji inspired.*

Boil water. Dissolve a 1 Tbsp of salt and 1 Tbsp of garam masala in water

Vegetables, about 1 kilo, but more works. Ideally add one kind of starchy vegetable,
such as a potato or yam. Cabbage, carrots, bell peppers and cauliflower work too.
Boil the vegetables for about in ten minutes in water.

While vegetables are boiling, in a large sauce pan, saute one onion, roughly chopped with
garlic, ginger and 1 tsp of cumin seed. For spice, add a serrano pepper. When onion is softened,
add a can of diced tomatoes. Stir in 1 tsp of turmeric, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of garam masala.
Protein options: frozen peas, chickpeas, tofu chunks.

Drain veggies and add to sauce pan. Lightly mash veggies. Stir and simmer. If too thick, add coconut milk.
Salt to taste.

You can serve this with rice, but honestly it's delicious and hearty by itself. Traditionally it's served with
bread.
