## Factions

**Waterfront Strays**

The Waterfront Strays are a group of disenfranchised animals that have banded together for mutual support and aid. Most of them
are workers who lost employment and families displaced by high rent from landlords. While nominally a crimminal organization,
they confine the targets of their mischief to the wealthy, particularly landlords and businessmen types.
