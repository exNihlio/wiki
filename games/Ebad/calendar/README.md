## Introduction

Several calendars are used in the Ebad subcontinent, though the most
frequently used is the Imperial Ardaanian (IA) calendar. The
Ardaanian empire actually used two separate calendar': the
aforementioned Imperial calendar and the religious calendar, though
the latter exists purely as a matter of historical study.

The Imperial Adaanian calendar is dated to the formal settling of the
the Ardaanina empire in the Ardaan plateau.

## Gailani Calendar

The Gailani Calendar (GC) is principally used in the Gailani nation 
and a few outlying island nations. The calendar is dated to purported
year of the Gailani Seúrd-dan Atheria settling the Great Hall in the 
city of Láicich.
