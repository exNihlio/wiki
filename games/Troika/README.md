## The Tower of Miskalos

Some time, thousands, or perhaps millions of years ago the dead flesh of an elder god embedded in a comet crashed onto a planet.
The heat of the impact melted the ice and the corrupted, necrotic flesh of a long dead thing-that-should-not-be oozed out. The flesh
began to corrupt the world, twisting all life, poisoning the water and remaking the land in the shape of this long dead being.

In a desperate panic, the inhabitants of this doomed planet sought a way to escape, intending to construct generational starships in orbit.
The first stage of this project was a to build a space elevator. While the space elevator was successfully built, the planet's land and oceans
were irrevocably poisoned and societal collapse followed to quickly to begin construction of the starships. The last few survivors retreated above the toxic gases, warping fumes and undulating metal-flesh that was covering the planet into the space elevator.

The survivors spent thousands of years building lives for themselves inside of the halls of the of the space elevator, renamed the Tower of
Miskalos. Sadly for them they brought the corruption inside with them and now the tower itself is a twisted reflection of the dead elder god.
Rooms of flesh, non-euclidean tunnels, people melded into walls, half-formed plant-animals and more infest the various floors and habitats that
stretch up and down the Tower.

The Tower of Miskalos also has acquired a position as a popular trading hub, particular for body altering chemicals and in the mutant slave trade.
As such, trade flourishes for a variety of species, watched over by the careful and alien eyes of the Acid Toad Council, the merchant carter of
alien toads, the only creatures seemingly immune to the body warping effects of the dead god.

## Rooms

| Roll  | Room                                                                                                                             |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11    | The flesh webs. This room is filled with thick ropes of pale quivering flesh, oozing sweat and blood. Here and there the odd eyeball follows you. Touching the ropes causes one of them to strike the player, dealing 1d3 points of stamina damage.|
| 12    | Four-fold refractory. This room has a single entrance, but walking out of the room leads to somewhere else entirely. Leaving this room will lead another randomly generated room. Returning from that entrance will lead back to this room and leaving again will exit.|
| 13    | Reclamation pits. This massive chamber is filled with surging vats of chemicals, surging and reclaiming _something_.  It certainly has an absolutely unique smell.|
| 14    | The Flower Beds. This room has 1d6 large flowers in it, growing out of the floor and along the ground. The mouthes of the flowers are large and strangely inviting. If a player falls asleep in one of the flowers then they regain 2d6+2 points of stamina and lose a memory of the GM's choice. |
| 15    | Toad Market. Rows and rows of stalls here, selling various chemicals, potions, salves and unguents promising a variety of effects. Some of them might even work. |
| 16    | Cargo elevator filled with mushrooms. Where does it lead? |
| 21    | Slide-chute of spiders. Don't get bitten.
| 22    | Muck-dungeon. 2d6 cells, filled with living or prisoners. They plead for release and the guard (NPC table), seems rather eager for you leave quickly. |
| 23    | Multi-species bathroom. This room is filled with various toilets and stalls, all configured for a species and creatures that you've never seen before. None seem to something that is compatible with your anatomy. The room smells faintly of lavender and sulphur. |
| 24    | Hallucinogenic gas chamber. Roll a ${check}. Failure results in a -1 modifier to all checks for the next 2 hours as you see the most wondrous visions of brightly colored tentacled beasts. |
| 25    | The room which breathes and bleeds. The wall in this room inhale and exhale in the most unsettling way and the edges of the wall slowly sseep blood. There is a vague scent of bile in the air. |
| 26    | Dimensional arboreteum. This room appears to be a greenhouse for a variety alien plants. Rows and rows of various plants, crops and suculents sit in metal shelves and the air is hot and moist. |
