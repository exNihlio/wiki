## The Tower of Miskalos

Some time, thousands, or perhaps millions of years ago the dead flesh of an elder god embedded in a comet crashed onto a planet.
The heat of the impact melted the ice and the corrupted, necrotic flesh of a long dead thing-that-should-not-be oozed out. The flesh
began to corrupt the world, twisting all life, poisoning the water and remaking the land in the shape of this long dead being.

In a desperate panic, the inhabitants of this doomed planet sought a way to escape, intending to construct generational starships in orbit.
The first stage of this project was a to build a space elevator. While the space elevator was successfully built, the planet's land and oceans
were irrevocably poisoned and societal collapse followed to quickly to begin construction of the starships. The last few survivors retreated above the toxic gases, warping fumes and undulating metal-flesh that was covering the planet into the space elevator.

The survivors spent thousands of years building lives for themselves inside of the halls of the of the space elevator, renamed the Tower of
Miskalos. Sadly for them they brought the corruption inside with them and now the tower itself is a twisted reflection of the dead elder god.
Rooms of flesh, non-euclidean tunnels, people melded into walls, half-formed plant-animals and more infest the various floors and habitats that
stretch up and down the Tower.

The Tower of Miskalos also has acquired a position as a popular trading hub, particular for body altering chemicals and in the mutant slave trade.
As such, trade flourishes for a variety of species, watched over by the careful and alien eyes of the Acid Toad Council, the merchant carter of
alien toads, the only creatures seemingly immune to the body warping effects of the dead god.

| 11    | This room is filled with thick ropes of pale quivering flesh, oozing sweat and blood. Here and there the odd eyeball follows you.|
| 12    | Four-fold refractory. This room has a single entrance, but walking out of the room leads to somewhere else entirely.             |
| 13    | Reclamation pits. This massive chamber is filled with surging vats of chemicals, surging and reclaiming _something_.             |
