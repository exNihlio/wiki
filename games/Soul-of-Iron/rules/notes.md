## Notes

- Custom dice pool, roll dice at start of round, assign to cards for
  actions. Cards cost specific dice.

- Cards have a speed, 1-3. Lower is faster and resolve first. 

- Reactor management is key. Every card has a reactor cost and once
  you go over your reactor you have to cool down.

- Every mech has some generic cards assigned to it, for example
  a 'Cool Off' for resetting the reactor and a 'Walk' card for a 
  short distance movement.

- Turn flow:
  - Roll a dice pool
  - Assign card orders to a mech
  - Flip cards, assign dice to actions
